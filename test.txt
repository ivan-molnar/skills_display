1/ Real research from context to specific subjects with a good approach: info is not only accurate in general but can answer a specific need. I like the comments you made on each resource and particularly the ‘must have’ category. I would have liked to see more of your methodology, but all in all, the purpose is understood and met. 2/ The research project is fully realized. Great organization, in the process, in the data. Resources are identified, verified, according to needs and to their value. The result is an excellent basis if you wanted to go through the scenario, I couldn’t find a corner of the subject you neglected. You could use your research as a great tool and project management basis. OVERALL/involved, curious, with a solid method and understanding of the subject from the beginning but still added skills and efficiency.

Mostly good style, the use of parentheses with the if expression was a bit strange.

Source: Good points: - Clear, neat and well structured Improvements: - Non-idiomatic choices such as using List.map |> ignore instead of List.iter - Some commented code and TODOs in main branch Scope: Good points: - Scope everything outside of the MP3 developed correctly - Some interesting extensions, such as handling stereo Improvements -Looks like a good start to decoding an MP3, but no tests for this code, so can’t see if it would work Devops: Good points: - Generation and deployment of nuget package Improvements: - No automated build - No approvals requirement for pull requests - Few discussions or descriptions on pull requests
